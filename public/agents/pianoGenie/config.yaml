    eventBuffer: false # A buffer with all the MIDI events played by the user since the last tick (grid slot).
    quantizedEvents: false # The time-quantized (or grid-aligned) MIDI events that correspond to the current tick (grid slot).
    # Set the polyphony that your music algorithm supports. Euterpe limits the user's input polyphony
    # so that you don't have to do it. Currently, it only applies to the quantizedEvents (gridBased mode)
    polyphony:
      input: 1
    # Optional feature to better align the user's input with the metronome
    # It drastically improves the displayed score due to better the better alignment.
    # For details, check our paper (section 3.4.1)
    # Use only when necessary though, as it might introduce clock/tempo instabilities.

# The settings for the clockBased operation.
# These are taken into account not only if "noteMode: true"
clockSettings:
  # You need to set the clock's tick duration.
  # This can happen either by: 

  # ---- OPTION 1: setting timeSignature, ticksPerBeat and BPM
  ticksPerBeat: 4 # use that for 16th-note grid on 4/4
  timeSignature:
    numerator: 4
    denominator: 4
  # This is just the default value. The user can later change it
  # from the settings menu (effectively changing the clock's period)
  defaultBPM: 100

  # ---- OPTION 2: 
  # Set the clockPeriod explicitly (milliseconds >100)
  # if not null, then the ticksPerBeat, timeSignature and defaultBPM are ignored
  # Use only if your music interaction algorithm
  # operates on a "free-time" mode (no BPM or timeSignature)
  clockPeriod: null
